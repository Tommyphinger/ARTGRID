# AI Coder Backend Prompt: ARTGRID - UoPeople Digital Art Exhibition Platform

I want to build a comprehensive Python Flask backend for ARTGRID, a digital art exhibition platform that showcases University of the People (UoPeople) students' artwork. This backend should handle student verification, artwork submissions, moderation workflows, and community features while integrating seamlessly with our existing Next.js frontend.

## Project Name:
ARTGRID - UoPeople Digital Art Community

## Target Audience:
• UoPeople students (artists and art enthusiasts)
• Faculty members and academic staff
• University administration and chancellor
• Prospective students and external visitors

## Core Backend Features and API Endpoints:

### User Authentication & Verification System
• Student registration with UoPeople email verification
• Secure login/logout with JWT tokens
• Profile management with mandatory fields:
  - Full name (as in UoPeople records)
  - Date of birth (hashed for privacy)
  - Student ID/email verification
  - Year of study (freshman, sophomore, etc.)
  - Profile image upload for verification
• Password reset functionality
• Role-based access (student, moderator, admin)

### Artwork Submission & Management
• File upload system supporting:
  - Image formats: JPG, PNG, GIF (up to 10MB)
  - Video formats: MP4 (up to 10MB)
  - Automatic file validation and virus scanning
• Artwork metadata collection:
  - Title (required, max 100 chars)
  - Description (optional, up to 500 chars)
  - Art medium (dropdown: digital art, painting, drawing, photography, sculpture, mixed media)
  - Creation date
  - Tags for searchability
  - Category assignment (mandatory)
• Bulk import functionality for initial 100 artworks
• Image optimization and thumbnail generation via Cloudinary

### Moderation & Approval Workflow
• 20-minute approval process with queue management
• Moderation dashboard for approvers
• Three-status system: pending/approved/rejected
• Auto-approval logic for verified UoPeople students
• Rejection feedback system with predefined reasons
• Moderator notification system (email/SMS alerts)
• Approval history tracking and audit logs

### Community Engagement Features
• Like/unlike system for artworks
• Comment system with profanity filtering
• Social sharing integration (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram)
• Guest viewing with account creation for interactions
• Featured/spotlight artwork selection system
• User profiles with portfolio galleries (up to 10 artworks initially)

### Analytics & Reporting Dashboard
• Real-time statistics for chancellor presentation:
  - Total submissions and approval rates
  - Student engagement by year of study
  - Popular artworks (by likes/views/shares)
  - Category breakdowns and trends
  - Monthly/weekly activity reports
• Exportable charts and reports (PDF/CSV)
• User activity tracking and engagement metrics

## Tech Stack (Recommended):

### Backend Framework & Core
• **Framework**: Flask with Flask-RESTful for API endpoints
• **Database**: SQLite (development) with SQLAlchemy ORM, PostgreSQL migration path
• **Authentication**: Flask-JWT-Extended for secure token management
• **File Storage**: Cloudinary free tier for image/video optimization
• **Email**: Flask-Mail with Gmail SMTP or SendGrid free tier

### Database Schema Design
• **Users Table**: id, full_name, email, password_hash, dob_hash, student_id, year_of_study, profile_image_url, verification_status, role, created_at
• **Artworks Table**: id, user_id, title, description, medium, category, file_url, thumbnail_url, tags, creation_date, status, submission_date, approval_date, likes_count, views_count
• **Moderations Table**: id, artwork_id, moderator_id, action, feedback, timestamp
• **Likes Table**: id, user_id, artwork_id, timestamp
• **Comments Table**: id, user_id, artwork_id, content, timestamp, is_flagged

### Additional Libraries & Tools
• **Image Processing**: Pillow for local image handling
• **Async Tasks**: Celery for background jobs (email notifications, file processing)
• **Content Filtering**: Basic profanity filter or Perspective API integration
• **Data Validation**: Marshmallow for request/response serialization
• **Security**: Flask-CORS, rate limiting, input sanitization
• **Analytics**: Basic SQL queries with optional Matplotlib for chart generation
